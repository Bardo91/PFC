This section explain the set up of the application used on simulations with images taken by real quadrotors inside the CATEC's Testbed \cite{CATEC}. The position and orientation of the drones is obtained with a VICON system.

As mentioned previously in section \ref{sec:SoftArch} the versatility of the applications makes possible to adapt fast the persecutor's software and in case of the Ground Station to use the same application.
