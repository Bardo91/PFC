Many approaches of vision system employing region segmentation by color were developed lately. Real-time color based algorithms can be implemented on hardware, but this document describes a fast and non-specific-platform software to deal with it. The software is composed in three parts: Fist one deal with the image, extracting the 2D-objects, this step is called Color Image Segmentation \cite{JamesBruce} (or Color Cluster Segmentation: \textbf{CCS} in future mentions); The second one, receive the 2D-object of the previous step and math the objects between two cameras; Afterward the Extended Kalman Filter (\textbf{EKF}), performing with geometric, return the 3D-objects. The last part of the software deal with the communication between both observers in order to arrange the information. Later in section 1.6, a larger explanation of the Software Architecture will be provided.
