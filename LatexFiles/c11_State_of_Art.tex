Computer vision entails mining information from images and video to extract meaningful information. We encounter state-of-the-art computer vision techniques every day-surveillance camera systems, face detection in our digital cameras, sports analysis, and the recent very popular Kinect system by Microsoft \cite{Kinect_intro}, to name a few. In all of these situations, computer algorithms process images and video to get useful information, so that a human user need not look through, say, hours and hours of surveillance footage. Computer vision research has come a long way over the decades, and today you can take a picture of an object on your cellphone camera and search for it, without typing a word. We will cover a computer vision algorithm we are developing at the Group of Robotics, Vision and Control at the University of Seville.
