\subsection{Extended Kalman Filter}

The Kalman Filter is an iterative algorithm that obtain an estimation of a lineal dynamic system when sensors has white noise. In this case, the system is non-linear so it's used a variant called Extended Kalman Filter \cite{GabrielTerejanu} (or EKF ). To apply the algorithm it's necessary to use a linealization of the known system described previously.

Consider the following nonlinear system described by the difference equation and the observation model with additive noise: \\
