	The main target of this document is to describe the results of the implemented computer vision algorithm for surveillance that would be run in an embedded computer inside a quadcopter \cite{Image_processing_UAV}.  \\
	
	Firstly, previously to talk about those results, there's an explanation of each fragment of the algorithm and their equations. \\
	The following chapter, is about the first implementation inside a simulator. The program of the ground station would be the same as the real, but quadcopters and cameras are simulated with V-REP software. \\
	Finally, on the last chapter, the application will be tested inside the embedded computers "Odroid u3" in order to get as much information as possible about speediness of the  algorithm and errors on estimations.
